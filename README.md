# Penguin_Runner
Penguin runner is a basic platformer style game made exclusively using the pygame library. One controls the penguin with a, d, and space to move left, right, and jump respectively. There are two levels and a "win" level. Avoid the spikes to reach the igloo to make the next level. To play the game, simply run the running_game.py file with pygame installed and the images loaded in the directory. Furthermore, if one gets stuck clicking a point on the screen will teleport the penguin to that spot.

The game ultimately stuck to the proposal, the only thing that changed was deciding the theme was going to be about penguins. 

Separation of work:
All game concepts and design philosophies were generated by the group. While we all contributed to all parts of the game, David's main contribution was coding the logic and strucuture of the game. In addition, David designed level 2 and the win screen after beating the two levels. Steven designed level 1, includng creating a fish teleporation gimmic for that level, and he helped bridged level 1 and level 2 together as there were some confusion/miscommunication between the images used in both levels. Andrew participated in the brainstorming stage.
