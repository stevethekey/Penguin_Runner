# Penguin_Runner
Penguin runner is a basic platformer style game made exclusively using the pygame library. One controls the penguin with a, d, and space to move left, right, and jump respectively. There are two levels and a "win" level. Avoid the spikes to reach the igloo to make the next level. To play the game, simply run the running_game.py file with pygame installed and the images loaded in the directory.

The game ultimately stuck to the proposal, the only thing that changed was deciding the theme was going to be about penguins. 

Separation of work:
All game concepts and design philosophies were generated by the group. While we all contributed to all parts of the game, David's main contribution was coding the logic and strucuture of the game. Steven's was level design. Andrew's was graphics and user interface.
